        <h5>Filter Kappi</h5>
        <p>As soon as you see those two metal containers, the cup and the deep saucer, in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, you know you're about to get something good. Locally grown coffee in southern India is roasted and finely ground, percolated, topped with frothed milk, and then "pulled" between the cup and saucer, a process that cools and mixes the liquid. Delicious. And it costs about 10 cents.

        <h5> Turkish Coffee</h5>
        <p>As the name indicates Turkish coffee originates from Turkey.

It’s basically unfiltered coffee. It’s also called as ‘Bosnian coffee’, Turkish coffee is a big part of their traditional wedding customs.

Turkish coffee is also used as fortune telling.</p>
<p>To make Turkish coffee you need to boil a cup of water.
After one boil you’ll add a tbsp of coffee powder 1/8 tsp of cardamom when foam starts to form then turn off the heat.
Turn on the heat again to allow it to foam. Then pour it into a coffee mug and serve!</p>
<p>Stir the coffee and water before placing on medium heat. I’ve found (after several experiments) that this increases the amount of foam on top.
Pour the coffee into the cups slowly and do not stir once you have poured it in. This is all to help retain the foam as much as possible.
It is normal for the coffee to settle to the bottom of the cups.
Turkish coffee is traditionally served with water and Turkish Delights or other sweets. The small Turkish coffee cups are excellent to retain the foam. If you do not have them, espresso cups will also work.</p>
